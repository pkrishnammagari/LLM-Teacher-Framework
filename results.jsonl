These components include:\n\n1. **Chunking**: This step involves dividing large text documents into smaller, more manageable chunks or \"chunks\" for efficient processing and storage.\n\n2. **Embedding**: Each chunk is then converted into a numerical representation called an embedding, which captures its semantic meaning. These embeddings enable efficient similarity searches during retrieval.\n\n3. **Vector Database**: A vector database stores the embeddings of the chunks along with associated metadata, such as document titles or IDs. This database facilitates quick retrieval of relevant information during RAG queries.\n\n4. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question or makes a request, the system first processes the query to extract important keywords or phrases. These extracted terms are then used to search the vector database for matching or related chunks.\n\n5. **Retrieval**: The retrieved chunks are ranked based on their relevance to the query using similarity metrics like cosine similarity. The top-ranked chunks are selected for further processing.\n\n6. **RAG Model**: The RAG model, typically a large language model like GPT-3 or BERT, generates responses or answers based on the retrieved information. It combines its internal knowledge with the retrieved chunks to provide contextually appropriate responses.\n\n7. **Output Generation**: Finally, the RAG model generates a response based on its understanding of the query and the retrieved context.
